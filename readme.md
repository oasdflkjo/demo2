# OpenGL Particle System Project

## Current Implementation

1. Engine Core
   - Basic engine structure implemented with create, initialize, update, render, and destroy functions.
   - Delta time calculation for smooth animations and physics.

2. Window Management
   - WindowManager module created for handling window creation and OpenGL context setup.
   - Basic event handling for window close and destroy events.

3. Particle System
   - Simple particle system implemented with position, velocity, color, and lifetime properties.
   - Basic update and render functions for particles.

4. Main Loop
   - Main game loop implemented in main.c, utilizing the engine functions.

5. Build System
   - Makefile created for compiling the project.

## Next Steps

1. Input Handling
   - Implement the InputManager to handle keyboard and mouse events.
   - Integrate input handling into the engine update loop.

2. Renderer
   - Develop the Renderer module to handle more complex rendering tasks.
   - Implement basic shape rendering (e.g., points, lines, triangles) for particles.

3. Shader Management
   - Create the ShaderManager module to load, compile, and manage shaders.
   - Implement basic vertex and fragment shaders for particle rendering.

4. Particle System Enhancements
   - Add more sophisticated particle behaviors (e.g., gravity, attraction/repulsion).
   - Implement particle emitters with different shapes and emission patterns.

5. OpenGL Modern Features
   - Transition from legacy OpenGL to modern OpenGL (3.3+) using Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) and Vertex Array Objects (VAOs).
   - Implement instanced rendering for improved particle system performance.

6. User Interaction
   - Add controls for users to interact with the particle system (e.g., mouse interaction, parameter adjustments).

7. Performance Optimization
   - Profile the application and optimize performance bottlenecks.
   - Consider using compute shaders for particle updates on the GPU.

8. Visual Enhancements
   - Implement more advanced rendering techniques (e.g., blending, texture mapping).
   - Add visual effects like trails or glow to particles.

By following these steps, you'll continue to build upon your solid foundation and create a more feature-rich and performant particle system.
