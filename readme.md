# OpenGL Particle System Project

## Project Overview

This project is an advanced OpenGL-based particle system that demonstrates modern graphics programming techniques. It features a high-performance particle simulation using compute shaders, interactive elements, and custom rendering effects.

## Current Implementation

1. Engine Core
   - Robust engine structure with create, initialize, update, render, and destroy functions.
   - Efficient main game loop implemented in `main.c`.

2. Window Management
   - Custom `WindowManager` module for handling window creation and OpenGL context setup.
   - Borderless fullscreen window implementation for immersive experience.
   - Basic event handling for window close and destroy events.

3. OpenGL Setup
   - Modern OpenGL 4.6 core profile context creation.
   - Comprehensive OpenGL function loading system.

4. Renderer
   - Advanced rendering system capable of handling particles and custom cursor.
   - Post-processing effects implementation (e.g., glitch effect).

5. Particle System
   - High-performance particle system using compute shaders.
   - Support for a large number of particles (100,000+).
   - Interactive particle behavior responding to mouse input.

6. Input Handling
   - `InputManager` implementation for keyboard and mouse input processing.
   - Custom cursor rendering and mouse position tracking.

7. Shader Management
   - Vertex, fragment, and compute shader support.
   - Shader program creation and management system.

8. Memory Management
   - Proper allocation and deallocation of resources throughout the engine lifecycle.

## Key Features

- High-performance particle simulation using compute shaders.
- Interactive particle behavior responding to mouse movement.
- Custom cursor rendering for enhanced user experience.
- Post-processing effects for visual enhancement.
- Fullscreen borderless window for immersive display.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

- `engine.c`: Core engine functionality.
- `window_manager.c`: Window creation and management.
- `input_manager.c`: Input handling and processing.
- `particle_system.c`: Particle simulation and rendering.
- `renderer.c`: OpenGL rendering and post-processing.
- `shader_manager.c`: Shader compilation and program management.
- `gl_loader.c`: OpenGL function loading.

## Building and Running

The project uses a Makefile for compilation. To build and run the project:

1. Ensure you have a C compiler and OpenGL development libraries installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `make` to build the project.
4. Execute the resulting binary to run the application.

## Next Steps

1. Performance Optimization
   - Profile the application to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
   - Implement instanced rendering for further performance improvements.

2. Feature Enhancements
   - Add more particle properties (e.g., size, rotation) and behaviors.
   - Implement additional post-processing effects.

3. User Interaction
   - Expand user controls for manipulating the particle system.
   - Add GUI elements for adjusting simulation parameters.

4. Error Handling and Logging
   - Implement a comprehensive error logging system.
   - Enhance error checking and recovery mechanisms.

5. Cross-platform Support
   - Extend the build system for cross-platform compatibility.
   - Abstract platform-specific code for easier porting.

6. Documentation and Testing
   - Add comprehensive code documentation.
   - Implement unit and integration tests for core components.
