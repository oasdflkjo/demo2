To approach your new OpenGL project with modularity in mind, the key is to balance structure with quick feedback. Here's a roadmap to guide the process:

1. Engine Core First (High-Level Overview)
Objective: Define an engine core that handles essential components like window management, input, rendering, and particle systems.
Why First?: This sets the foundation, allowing each subsystem to be isolated and testable but also ensures you can get something on the screen quickly.
Action Plan: Implement an Engine object early, which will serve as a manager for all other systems. This ensures that each component is nicely abstracted and independent but works together through the engine.
2. Windowing and Renderer Initialization (Fast Feedback)
Goal: The first tangible output (like an empty window with a color or a basic triangle) should come as quickly as possible.
Module: WindowManager – handle window creation and OpenGL context.
This module should be your first milestone. Set up the ability to initialize a window and render a single frame. Even if no particles are drawn yet, this visual confirmation will help maintain motivation.
Renderer: Once the window is up, the Renderer can be used to set up basic rendering commands. For example, displaying a color gradient or a simple geometric shape.
3. Input Handling (Usability from Day 1)
Objective: Input is crucial even early on. Implement InputManager to handle key presses and mouse events.
Why Early?: Even simple input handling—like pressing ESC to close the window—improves the feeling of interactivity, which can be motivating. This also avoids the risk of hardcoding interactions later.
Action Plan: After the window is rendering something, map a few basic inputs (like quitting, pausing, or toggling visual modes).
4. Modular Particle System (Core Visual Feature)
Objective: The core of your project is the particle system. Break this into manageable components that fit into your system while making the architecture scalable for future improvements.
Design: You can first implement the particle system minimally—just particles floating around the screen with a random initial velocity. This will provide a visual effect you can iterate on later.
Action Plan: The ParticleSystem module should initialize particle buffers and update particle positions in simple CPU calculations first, pushing to the GPU for rendering later.
5. Shader Management (Step Toward Complexity)
Why Modular?: Shaders will become increasingly complex, and separating their management into a ShaderManager module will keep the rendering system clean. This will help as you build more advanced effects like compute shaders for particle updates.
First Steps: Initially, you can use basic vertex and fragment shaders to render particles. Once the basic particle system works, add compute shaders for particle dynamics.
6. Iteration & Visualization (Motivation Through Results)
Strategy: Keep an iterative approach—get a simple system running quickly and expand it incrementally. After you see something simple on the screen (e.g., particles moving randomly), you can incrementally add features like mouse interaction, more sophisticated physics, or particle spawn rules.

Example Flow for Quick Progress:
WindowManager + Renderer → Empty window with a background color.
InputManager → Quit on ESC.
ShaderManager → Basic vertex and fragment shaders for rendering a triangle.
ParticleSystem → Simple particle effects, even as colored points, for fast feedback.
ShaderManager (v2) → Add more complex particle effects or compute shaders.

7. Time Management (Smooth Animations and Physics)
Objective: Implement delta time calculation in the engine to ensure smooth animations and physics, regardless of frame rate variations.
Why Important?: Consistent time-based updates are crucial for realistic particle behavior and smooth animations across different hardware.
Implementation:
- Add a TimeManager module to the engine core.
- Calculate delta time between frames.
- Use delta time in particle updates and any physics calculations.
Action Plan:
- Integrate TimeManager into the main engine loop.
- Update particle positions and velocities based on delta time rather than fixed intervals.
- This approach allows for frame-rate independent motion and effects.

By structuring it this way, you get the core systems up and running early and can continuously build upon them, which will help prevent you from losing momentum. The addition of proper time management ensures that your particle system will behave consistently across different hardware and varying frame rates.
