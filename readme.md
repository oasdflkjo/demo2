# OpenGL Particle System Project

## Current Implementation

1. Engine Core
   - Basic engine structure implemented with create, initialize, update, render, and destroy functions.
   - Main game loop implemented in main.c, utilizing the engine functions.

2. Window Management
   - WindowManager module created for handling window creation and OpenGL context setup.
   - Basic event handling for window close and destroy events.

3. OpenGL Setup
   - Modern OpenGL function loading implemented.
   - Basic shader compilation and program creation.

4. Renderer
   - Basic renderer implemented with a simple triangle drawing capability.
   - Shader program management for basic rendering.

5. Particle System
   - Simple particle system implemented with position, velocity, color, and lifetime properties.
   - Basic update and render functions for particles (currently using deprecated immediate mode).

6. Build System
   - Makefile created for compiling the project.

## Next Steps

1. Particle System Enhancements
   - Transition from immediate mode rendering to modern OpenGL using Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) and Vertex Array Objects (VAOs).
   - Implement a more sophisticated particle update system, possibly using compute shaders for improved performance.
   - Add more particle properties (e.g., size, rotation) and behaviors (e.g., acceleration, attraction/repulsion).

2. Renderer Improvements
   - Implement a flexible rendering system that can handle different types of objects (not just particles).
   - Add support for textures and more advanced shading techniques.

3. Shader Management
   - Extend the shader system to load shaders from files.
   - Implement a shader caching system to improve performance.

4. Input Handling
   - Implement the InputManager to handle keyboard and mouse events.
   - Add user interaction with the particle system (e.g., spawning particles with mouse clicks).

5. Performance Optimization
   - Profile the application and identify performance bottlenecks.
   - Implement instanced rendering for particles to improve rendering performance.

6. Error Handling and Logging
   - Implement a centralized error logging system.
   - Add more comprehensive error checking throughout the codebase.

7. Memory Management
   - Review and optimize memory usage, ensuring all resources are properly allocated and freed.

8. Build System
   - Enhance the Makefile to support different build configurations (debug, release).
   - Consider implementing a more advanced build system (e.g., CMake) for better cross-platform support.

9. Documentation
   - Add comprehensive comments to the code.
   - Create a basic user guide for running and interacting with the application.

10. Testing
    - Implement unit tests for core components.
    - Add integration tests to ensure different modules work together correctly.
